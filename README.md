Please download the data from the following link: https://1drv.ms/u/s!AiZ5YIg6i78a-mrCthkrO_uohpv9. The data is cleaned and we have removed the data that does not make sense (like those began in 1960). You can read the data directly using the tidyverse read_csv. It should not take a long time.

The original data set can be found on NYC Open Data: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Rodent-Inspection/p937-wjvj.
